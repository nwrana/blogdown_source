## About

I created this website as a way to catalogue my interest in the field of data science. At the time of writing this, Machine Learning is seeing termendous growth. Some of this is simply hype, but I believe we've entered a fundamental shift in which programs are beginning to write and optimize themself.As a Process Engineer, I am suprised at how little statistics, probability, and modelling are used in operations. I also see a wealth of operator and process specialist expertise and deduction that is never captured. *How can we capture in a program that 30 years of expericence tells us ? How can we use the knowledge of statistics, mathematics, and programming to capture the reasoning and critical thinking a person took years to develop ?* These are some of the questions I want to solve.  

The purpose of this blog is to help me:
1. Understand the underlying principles in which statistical models are built upon  
2. Explore in detail how to create more advanced models, specifically Probabilty Graphical Models and Neural Networks  
3. Apply this knowledge to projects and machine learning competitions  


## School

I am a Process Engineer with 6 years experience working directly in operations in both mining and manufacturing. I am a data scientist with a a passion for applying machine learning to approach practical industrial problems. I am a researcher with a M.Sc in Biosystems Engineering who studied the ability of bacteria to gerenate energy. I am a father and a husband with strong family values.
